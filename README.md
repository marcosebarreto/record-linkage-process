# Record Linkage Process

This project exposes the process of linking records, known as Record Linkage, between large databases using heterogeneous computing systems that offer high computional power, such as:

  - [CUDA C]
  - [MIC]

### To execute

* CUDA C code:

```sh
$ cd cuda-c
$ make
$ ./linkage
```
